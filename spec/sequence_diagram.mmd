    %% The `activate` is not rendering properly on my Mermaid Editor Preview, using Mermaid Editor from tomoyukim on a fresh install of VS Code; I also stopped using the Meta version of VS Code because there appeared to be a version conflict with GitHub. Nevertheless, I would be curious to know if the `activate` is rendering a rectangle on another system; here the render is only making a space for one... I thought it sensible to put one in for waiting time during the repairs, but generally I have removed all activate and deactivate keywords because they are not adding to the diagram.
